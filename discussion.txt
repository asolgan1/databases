MODIFICATIONS:
There were some issues in the database that we had to fix. First of all, some of the columns were misaligned, so setup.sql had to be updated to fix that.
Also, there were issues with PHP's prepared statements' bind function with the data type YEAR. So we changed the column type to INT instead and it works fine now

PROCESS: 
Our process was rather involved and complicated, see process.txt under dbase_setup for full details (it has not changed since phase C)

SUCCESSES:
Get all countries' basic information and Get All Countries' Annual Information function was complicated to do in the SQL, since they involve dynamically sorting by a column. 
Moreover, we feel that the UI/UX feels clean and easy to use. Bootstrap really helped make the project look and feel better.

KNOWN ISSUES:
No known issues

EXTENSIONS:
We would've liked to implement a few more features involving CanvasJS, or use a geographic map to showcase cases/deaths.
