Click on the csv link under Download. You should get this file: owid-covid-data.csv


https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress
Click the download icon and get country_vaccinations.csv
**NOTE: This is not an actual final relation in our database, it builds a temporary Vaccination table 
to be joined with Country. It's dropped immediately afterwards.

Click on the [Total,destination] link under data, you should get undesa_pd_2020_ims_stock_by_sex_and_destination.xlsx
This file needs some modifications; please go to the Table 3 sheet in the Excel file and remove all the columns except for B and L. Then remove all the pictures and remove all the blue rows because they contain region information, not country information. After that save the file as a csv and name it Country_migration.csv.

2. Run the scripts, I used terminal on Mac, so it looks like this for me 

python3 annualcountrydata.py

Please run all scripts, EXCEPT FOR country.py and get_countries.py for now. 

3. When you have the .txt files, you need to ensure that country names across different files are consistent. Unfortunately, different databases where we got the information from had different names for the same countries (like United States of America vs United States). Please refer to the countries_list.txt for the full list of countries generated with a python script get_countries.py and change any inconsistencies manually. 

After you change the 4 files called annualcountrydata, annualecondata, vaccination and coviddata according to the countries_list.txt, you can run the country.py script and get_countries.py script if you want to confirm the list of countries. 

Countries.txt file is tricky to fix. After you run the country.py script, look at country.txt. At the bottom you will see a list of countries that are not evenly spaced like the other countries in the list. Now press ctrl+F or Cmnd+F on mac and search every country that is in that bottom part of the file. Do not type the full name, just the main part of it (for example search Czech for Czech Republic or Ivoire for Cote d’Ivoire). If you find a country in the evenly spaced part of the list that has a similar name, rename that country in the evenly spaced part according to the name provided at the bottom part. After that, remove the whole line containing the name at the bottom. For example, you see Czech Republic at the bottom part of the list. Search ‘Czech’ and once you find Czechia in the top part of the list, change that name to Czech Republic. Then go back down to where it says Czech Republic in the bottom and and remove the whole line containing that name. If a country at the bottom part of the list isn’t duplicated (ie you can’t find a similar name at the top part of the list) just leave it there. 

Finally, we must do some minor cleanup. In country.txt, search for "..", and delete all instances. Similarly, in annualecondata.txt, search for "n/a", and delete all instances.

SETTING UP THE RELATIONS IN DBASE 
(The following instructions are for Mac only, Windows need to use Putty and their corresponding commands)

Before you do anything, make sure the directory is setup EXACTLY as follows:
The folder MUST be named DBProject, DON'T rename it.
All .txt and .sql files must be at the top level of DBProject

1. Login to ugrad via Terminal

ssh -l jhed ugrad24.cs.jhu.edu

Replace jhed with your JHED

2. Transfer Project folder to ugrad. Open a new terminal and do the following: 

scp -r jhed Desktop/dbase_setup jhed@ugrad24.cs.jhu.edu:

My Project folder is on my Desktop, if your folder is elsewhere, replace the path. 

3. Navigate via cd command to dbase_setup's top level on ugrad

4. Launch mysql to connect to dbase in ugrad. Replace username with your dbase username, replace dbname with your database's name. 

mysql -h dbase.cs.jhu.edu -u username -p dbname

5. You can run all our sql files from here by doing something like this (just replace setup.sql with whatever)

source ./setup.sql
